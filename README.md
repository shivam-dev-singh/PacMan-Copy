# PacMan-Copy 
(youtube link: https://youtu.be/r1KhKsP-6i0 )
An attempt to make a copy of PacMan game in python2.7 using pygame :)

Run start_game.py using python2.7 with pygame module installed.
In ubuntu , go to terminal and run using the command "python start_game.py" assuming python2.7 is your default python program.
If python3 is default then type "python2 start_game.py" to run the program.
